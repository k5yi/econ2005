Dynamic Model of Unionism and Wage Rate Determination for Young Men",
Journal of Applied Econometrics, Vol. 13, No. 2, 1998, pp. 163-183.

The data are taken from the National Longitudinal Survey (NLS Youth
Sample) and contain observations on 545 males for the years 1980-1987.
The variables are in alphabetical order, except for the first two which
indicate the NLS individual identification number and the year of
observation. The observations are ordered first by individual and
second by period. The variables are saved in column space delimited
format. Each line in the file contains one observation (NR, YEAR). 

The data are in the DOS file vv-data.dat, which is zipped in
vv-data.zip.

See Table 1 of the paper for a description of the variables and summary
statistics.
